Hey, I'm Yingqian Cao (a.k.a. Andrea)

I considered myself as a boundary-crossing explorer between data science and business analytics, hybridized from CMU's Intelligent Infrastructure Systems and UC Berkeley's Industrial Engineering & Operations Research.

I've built demand forecasting engines with Python/R for Maitland Management, decoded e-commerce growth patterns with machine learning for Alibaba, and mapped urban development blueprints with statistical modeling for Rwanda. Earlier in China, as the youngest engineering technician at China Construction Second Division, I optimized construction costs by 25% for Beijing Universal Studios using CAD and Primavera P6.

I studied Civil Engineering, at [North China University of Technology](https://en.ncut.edu.cn) and MS, Civil and Environmental Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu).
I am pursuing my second master degree at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu) as a MS, Industrial Engineering and Operations Research .
